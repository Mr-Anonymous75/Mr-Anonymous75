# Hi there!
I'm [Mr-Anonymous](https://mr-anonymous75.github.io). I'm just your ordinary definitely-not-Indian - okay, Indian - C# and Scratch coder, and Inkscape graphic designer.

## Coding

I code mostly with C# right now, and I'm working on learning both C++ and web development.

I'm addicted to stack overflow.<br>

## Graphic Design

I use Inkscape for vector design, though I would much prefer Ai - if I could afford it, that is. I also use GIMP for bitmap editing, though, once again, I would prefer Photoshop.

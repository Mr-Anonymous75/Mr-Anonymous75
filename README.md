# Hi there!
I'm The-Anonymous. I'm just your ordinary definitely-not-Indian - okay, Indian - C# and Scratch coder, and Inkscape graphic designer.

## Coding

I code mostly with C#. I also use [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/QuexizT), mostly because of the community. 

I'm currently learning Java. I'm procrastinating on learning JS and TypeScript, and I have plans to eventually learn C++.
I know the basics of HTML as well, though I'm working on learning more of it.

I'm addicted to stack overflow.<br>

## Graphic Design

I use Inkscape for vector design, though I would much prefer Ai - if I could afford it, that is. I also use GIMP for bitmap editing, though, once again, I would prefer Photoshop.
